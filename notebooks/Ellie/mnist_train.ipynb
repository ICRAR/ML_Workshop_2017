    "In this section, I will tell you how to build and train a neural network which recognizes handwritten digits. We use the MNIST dataset which is a collection of a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a good database for those who like to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting. We will be solving this classification problem with less than 120 lines of Python / TensorFlow / TF-Slim codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our neural network takes in handwritten digits and classifies them, i.e. states if it recognizes them as a 0, a 1, a 2 and so on up to a 9. Each image in the MNIST dataset is a 28x28 pixel greyscale image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is our main code for training the data. I have tried to make it as short and clear as possible. In this workshop, we will be using LeNet as the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, here we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, let's import our required modules. We need to import Tensorflow as the main platform. We also import `MNIST` which is the module for reading data in our desired fashion as well as `load_batch` that loads the data in batches of favorable size. The latter helps to not to go beyond our memory and computational facilities.  \n"
